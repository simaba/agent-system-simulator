A small, runnable simulator for controlled multi-agent workflows, demonstrating governance, orchestration, and evaluation through working code rather than documentation alone.

## Choose this repo when

Use this repository when you want a **concrete executable example** of:

- bounded retries
- fallback behavior
- escalation logic
- evaluator-driven acceptance
- traceable decision logs

This repo is intentionally narrower than:

- [`multi-agent-governance`](https://github.com/simaba/multi-agent-governance), which defines the governance model
- [`agent-orchestration`](https://github.com/simaba/agent-orchestration), which catalogs orchestration patterns
- [`agent-eval`](https://github.com/simaba/agent-eval), which defines broader evaluation dimensions and scenarios

## Why this exists

Agent systems are easy to describe but hard to reason about without running them. This simulator gives you a concrete, inspectable implementation of the core control patterns: explicit roles, bounded retries, fallback paths, escalation triggers, and evaluation.

The design principle is simple: a well-governed agent system should expose its control logic clearly enough to be debugged, tested, evaluated, and improved.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    P[Planner\nDecides how to handle the task] --> E
    E[Executor\nPerforms the task action] --> Ev
    Ev[Evaluator\nAssesses result quality] --> S
    S{Supervisor\nDecide outcome}
    S -->|Accept| Done[✓ Task complete]
    S -->|Retry| E
    S -->|Fallback| F[Fallback handler]
    S -->|Escalate| Esc[Human escalation]
```

## Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Planner** | Determines the strategy for handling the task |
| **Executor** | Performs the primary task action |
| **Evaluator** | Assesses whether the result meets acceptance criteria |
| **Supervisor** | Decides whether to accept, retry, fallback, or escalate |

## Quick start

Run the simulator directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simaba/agent-simulator.git
cd agent-simulator
python run_demo.py --scenario normal_success
```

Available scenarios:

```bash
python run_demo.py --scenario normal_success
python run_demo.py --scenario retry_then_success
python run_demo.py --scenario fallback_after_failure
```

Run tests:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

This repository currently uses only the Python standard library for runtime behavior. The optional dev dependency is only for tests.

## What each run produces

- decision log with full agent interaction trace
- retry and escalation events
- final outcome status
- latency measurements
- cost estimate
- evaluation summary metrics

See `examples/sample-output.md` for a full example run.
